A Child is lost upon the way home,
For he remembers the day for which everything went wrong.
It was like any other ordinary day,
The Screams of Mother and Father only increase by day.
For The Child wanted to try something New
He got his dad's computer, turned it on
For He saw his friend wanted him on
A new server he found, oh!
For It was his mistake,
One which he regretted to this day

For as the child grew and learned.
He unraveled some events for which.
Would torment him still to this day
Meanwhile he was slowly repenting his actions
For what had he done? To cause pain to others
For he had to build a path.

The Child was born, anew.
He felt a sense of relief, yet slimy.
As he ran away from the place he called home.
He settled at a place he thought would be fair.
Until war occured. and for he was drafted
For the man who ran had to come right back in
As he grew tired of it all.

Meanwhile Reality being so grim,
Gave The Child more and more to chew.
For his mother was slowly being gloomy
"Child, O' Child!"
"Yes, mama?"
"For i have built the world for you my Child!"
"For some days are dusk, and grim
But look onward! For the Future is bright"
But The Child Wanted No more.
So. For One Final time,
The Child ran away, From Everything.
And This time, with no return.
